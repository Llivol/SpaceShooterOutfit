# SpaceShooterOutfit
When I approached this project, I decided to keep the basics simple and build up a game that feels great. I also tried to reduce the components as much as I could to reuse them for several entities. This reusability can be seen on components like Stats or  Laser.

The most challenging part for me was the enemy's behavior. It was my first time programming anything similar to AI, and it felt quite overwhelming at the beginning. I think I have managed to create something simple but 'gamy'.
